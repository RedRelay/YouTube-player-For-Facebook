## Why use mine ?

* Free & Open source : no surprise, anyone can easily inspect code
    * Any addon which ask for your permission to access facebook.com should be transparent with you
* Very light : only CSS and native JS was used
    * I am not able to minify resources as Mozzila fundation should be able to easily understand what the addon do to be approved
* Advanced feature for better quality of life
    * When you load another YouTube video or Facebook native video, then all other YouTube video are paused
    * Sometimes I am not able to listen on video play status, that's why you have a "Pause All" feature above your YouTube player
* That's all the addon do !
    * No adverts
    * No tracking
