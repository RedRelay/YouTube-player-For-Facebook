I encourage you to give me a feedback by putting **vote & comment** onto the addon.  
And of course feel free to **share it on Facebook** to allow a lot of people to watch YouTube video on Facebook directly

## Why use mine ?

* Free & Open source : no surprise, anyone can easily inspect code
    * Any addon which ask for your permission to access facebook.com should be transparent with you
* Advanced feature for better quality of life
    * When you load another YouTube video or Facebook native video, then all other YouTube video are paused
    * In some case, for security reasons, I am not able to listen on video play status, that's why you have a "Pause All" feature above each YouTube player
* Very light : only CSS and native JS was used
* That's all the addon do !
    * No adverts
    * No tracking
